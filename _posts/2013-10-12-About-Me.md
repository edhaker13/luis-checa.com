I'm a junior software devolper from Stafford, United Kingdom.

You may be wondering why my name doesn't sound English in the least, well you're right. I'm actually Spanish!

Another thing you may be wondering is why my username is *'{{ site.username }}'*, to be completely honest, I made this username so long ago even I'm not completely sure. I think it was supossed to be a mix of my middle name *'Eduardo'*, my interest for hacking and my favourite number *'13'*; I think I dropped the *'c'* mainly to make sure it was different and always available as a username. *It could also be that I didn't know how to spell it*

I have a National Extended Diploma (BTEC L3) in Software Development, and I'm currently studying a Bacherlor's Degree in Games Programming at Staffordshire University.

My current job is Product Sytems Developer and Designer at a renewable energy company called Solar Panels Direct.
If you're still interested in me and my ideas it might be a good idea to follow this [blog]({{ get_url() }}) and/or subscribe to the [RSS]({{ get_url('feed.xml') }}) feed.

The most reliable way to get in touch with me via [email](mailto:luischeca@mail.com).

##Technologies and tools##

My current workdesk consists of a custom built desktop PC:

- CPU: AMD FX-8350
- RAM: 8GB DDR3 1600MHz
- Monitors: 24" 1080p (Portrait) and a 27" 1440p
- Disk Drives: 250GB Samsung 840 SSD and a 3TB Toshiba HDD
  Used primarily for gaming, work, studies, reddit and of course: coding.

This PC started out as a normal store bought desktop (Acer Insipre M6220, if anyone's curious) but I began the long and painful transition of upgrading it's components when I first discovered the joys of PC gaming.

I also own a ~~Google Nexus 4~~ stunning OPPO Find 7 smart phone, and a Google Nexus 7 tablet; both of these are the first devices I bought entirely out of my own money.

My weapon of choice is the hyper-flexible, batteries-included [Python](http://python.org), I love this language to bits.
I began coding when somehow I discovered HTML and webpages when I was 7 or 8, then I moved on to tinkering with languages for my game consoles (I Think a PSP, and a NDS), then Visual Basic, afterwards I came across a website offering free shell accounts: [Shellmix](http://shellmix.com) and started using linux.

I've fiddle with any coding language that I've come across, but Python just struck me as beautifully simple and easy to read, on of the major reasons though, is that I'd been working on some project in Java and grew to hate the amount of boilerplate and verbosity in the language.

Although, I've wrestled with some of the major languages out there, I should only say I'm able to use Python, Java, and VBA; I'm currently working out polishing my C++ and C# at University.

##My Software##

Most of my projects are open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.username }}), please excuse me before hand if you see some unclear descriptions *(English is not my first language)* and lack of license declarations *(I never get them right)*.

Other projects such as websites and old console apps were lost in the interwebs, I'm sure they're out there somewhere. There are also projects I created to automate some tasks at work, however due to the NDA I signed I'm unable to disclose them.

Recently we (a team of 6 students, including me) developed a game idea using Contruct2 a a part of our [freshers welcome week](http://www.fcet.staffs.ac.uk/pfb1/welcomeweek/2013/) at Stafford University. We made a 2D Multiplayer Maze with limited visibilty to enhance *(deterr?)* gameplay.

The game was to be developed during the 3 days remaining of our welcome week, after which it would be jugded by the fine folks visiting from CodeMasters. Out of 15-20 groups they would select 3 games they thought Creative, Innovative, and Unique.

~~*Un*~~Surpringly our game idea made it to the final and not only that, ***we won!***

Here's a link where you can see what the game looked like in at the competition [AmazD - Team 42](http://www.fcet.staffs.ac.uk/pfb1/welcomeweek/2013/games/42/). The objective of the game is to find your way through the maze to the other player's spawn point (marked by the red or blue sector).
*(Looks like whatever framework the were using proved not to be update friendly as it just loads a blank screen)*

The controls are simple: WASD for player 1 and the arrow keys for player 2, also there are coloured items that are either buffs or debuffs so be careful!

At some point I'll write a more detailed post going over how, and why we did what we did, also there are plans to improve it and publish it on the Windows Store so keep an eye out for us.
